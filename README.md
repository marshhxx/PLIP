Production Line Image Processing (PLIP)
======
An image recognition system based on Open CV and JAVA designed to validate pharmaceutical orderâ€™s. 

Worked with a distributor which has a semi-automatic line to prepare pharmaceutical orders and deliver them to drugstores.
The necessity: More than 500 orders were delivered with mistakes: some products were missing, there were more products than the ones in the order or the products were confused for others.
We introduced PLIP to the last step of the production line, just with a camera & light structure, we detected when a new order arrived to our system, took a photo and with a product counting and image processing matching algorithm we validate the order and detect if there were any errors.

Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah! ...These are the magic words that Tingle created himself. Don't steal them!
